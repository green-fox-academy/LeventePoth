I love to design complex systems with high levels of automation including AI and robotics. I'm
deeply interested in inventing new things that can augment the human experience.

Everything I done, everything ill do today, everything ill ever do, I do to protect this
world. Someoneonce told me that withgreat power comes comes great responsibily.

Erika had been profiled numerous times in many different forums, and her insights on design, business and technology were well known. I was after something narrower, though. I wanted to hear about the nitty gritty of her professional journey, the trials and tribulations she encountered in finding meaningful work, and the stories of her lucky breaks and less lucky mishaps. The goal of How They Got There was to document the random things that conspire together to forge every career, even very high profile ones like Erikaâ€™s.
